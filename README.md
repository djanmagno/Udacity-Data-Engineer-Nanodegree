## About The Nanodegree

The data engineering field is expected to continue growing rapidly over the next several years, and there’s huge demand for data engineers across industries. This Data Engineer Nanodegree program is comprised of content and curriculum to support six (6) projects. It is estimated to complete the program in five (5) months working 10 hours per week.

Each project will be reviewed by the Udacity reviewer network and a feedback is provided and if the student does not pass the project, he will be asked to resubmit the project until it passes.

The objective here consists in learning to design data models, build data warehouses and data lakes, automate data pipelines, and work with massive datasets. 

At the end of the program, the student will combine the acquired new skills by completing a capstone project.

Educational Objectives:
* Create user-friendly relational and NoSQL data models
* Create scalable and efficient data warehouses
* Work efficiently with massive datasets
* Build and interact with a cloud-based data lake
* Automate and monitor data pipelines
* Develop proficiency in Spark, Airflow, and AWS tools

## **Program Details**

During this program,  the student will complete four courses and five projects. Throughout the projects,  he will play part of a data engineer at a music streaming company. He will work with the same type of data in each project, but with increasing data volume, velocity, and complexity. below you can find a course-by-course breakdown.

Associated notebooks for this course can be found [here](https://github.com/djanmagno/Udacity-Data-Engineer-Nanodegree/tree/master/Notebook-Exercises).

#### **Course 1 – Data Modeling**

In this course,  the student will learn to fit the diverse needs of data
consumers, understanding the differences between different data models, and how to choose the
appropriate data model for a given situation. He will also build fluency in PostgreSQL and Apache Cassandra.

**Project 01 - Data Modeling with Postgres**

In this project, the student will model user activity data for a music streaming app called Sparkify. He will create a relational database and ETL pipeline designed to optimize queries for understanding what songs users are listening to. In PostgreSQL he will also define Fact and Dimension tables and insert data into the new tables created.

**Project 02 - Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra**

In these projects, the student will model user activity data for a music streaming app called Sparkify. He will create a database and ETL pipeline, in Apache Cassandra, he will model the data so he can run specific queries provided by the analytics team at Sparkify.

<!-- #### **Course 2 – Cloud Data Warehouses**

In this course,  we will learn to create cloud-based data warehouses. In the project,  we will build an ELT pipeline that extracts data from Amazon S3, stages it in Amazon Redshift, and transforms it into a set of dimensional tables.

Associated notebooks for this course can be found [here](###). 

Project 3 can be found [here](###). 

#### **Course 3 – Data Lakes with Apache Spark**

In this course,  we will learn more about the big data ecosystem, how to work with massive datasets with Apache Spark, and how to store big data in a data lake. In the project,  we will build an ETL pipeline for a data lake using Apache Spark and S3.

Associated notebooks for this course can be found [here](###).

Project 4 can be found [here](###). 

#### **Course 4 – Data Pipelines with Apache Airflow**

In this course,  we will learn to schedule, automate, and monitor data pipelines using Apache Airflow. In the project, they’ll continue your work on the music streaming company’s data infrastructure by creating and automating a set of data pipelines. 

Associated notebooks for this course can be found [here](###).

Project 5 can be found [here](###). 

#### **Capstone Project**
